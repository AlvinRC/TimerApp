This will be an application which will play an alarm sound when the interval is reached
(Maybe have some additional functionality? like as a desktop widget?)

Progress:
- Displays console message when alarm time is reached
- Added stop alarm functionality
- Added Better Format 
- Added easy exit timer
- Made it fully functional on PC in the terminal
- Started on GUI
- Added feature (run multiple programs at once when button is pressed + store this config for future use)

Current plans:
- add nice GUI (desktop)
- remove lag and delays
- make it fully functional from GUI
